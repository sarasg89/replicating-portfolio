In order to be able to send emails from the contact form, I used [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMq2riFCF90&t=8s&ab_channel=ChaooCharles). I then run into some problems with dotenv not working with Webpack v5 so I had to create a server to hide my API keys. I followed this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-react-app-with-a-node-backend-the-complete-guide/) from freeCodeCamp.Lastly, I was having issues with the API not reading the .env file so I changed the execution path as recommended in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42335016/dotenv-file-is-not-loading-environment-variables) Stack Overflow post.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41938718/how-to-download-files-using-axios) post on Stack Overflow helped me figure out how to download files using Axios.

In order to get the modal to work with React, I had to read some articles that explained how to write a function to show/hide the modal. I found [this](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/modal/) one especially helpful.

I used the same [site](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/offcanvas/) to work out the off-canvas navbar.

Because I wanted to make the contact form actually functional I ran into several problems during deployment when I initially tried to deploy the whole app to Heroku. In the end I had to take the following steps:

1. Remove the server/client folder structure from main and leave only the contents of the client folder (public, src, package.json, etc.)
2. I was finally able to deploy the app with GitHub Pages but now the contact form and resume download were not working because they previously relied on a separate node server
3. I created a new [repository](https://github.com/sarasg89/portfolio-server) for the server and deployed it to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/ssg-portfolio-server)
4. I updated the API calls in the client to point to the Heroku server
5. I enable CORS support on the Heroku server so that GitHub Pages could access it. I achieved by following [this](https://stackabuse.com/handling-cors-with-node-js/) tutorial
