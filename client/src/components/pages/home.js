            <h2>Full stack developer.</h2>
            <p>I am a part-time student at UofT's Coding Bootcamp in the evening and full-time Project Accountant during the day. 
            For the last 6 months I have been learning the fundamentals of web development and I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a developer.
            The projects I have worked on so far required the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, React.js, and Bootstrap.
