                For the last 6 months I have been learning the fundamentals of web development and I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a developer.
                The projects I have worked on so far required the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, React.js, and Bootstrap.
